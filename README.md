# York
The track was recorded after several hours of session 
jamming with guitars and pianos. The results were disppointing. 
Texture and substance was missing from the final track. 
To compensate for this, and to end the evening on a more positive
note, the next 15 minutes was spent with a notebook and synth, 
resulting in the track "York". 

The track was named from the inspiration of Thom Yorke's recent 
releases, including from the works of Atoms for Peace, as well 
as Fever Ray's solo efforts.
